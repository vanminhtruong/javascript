          Despite some small changes, the story of Leon Kennedy infiltrating a
          rural village in Spain to save the President’s daughter from a
          terrorist cult looking to infect the world with a mind-controlling
          parasite is exactly how players of the original will remember it.
          Resident Evil 4 maintains a tightrope narrative balance of horror
          and pure camp with a unique cast of characters that newer players
          won’t forget.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, how can Capcom improve on an action shooter many considered
          perfect without losing the white-knuckled action experience of the
          original? The answer is by offering refinements brought by the last
          few remakes while introducing some clever gameplay tweaks, all
          backed by the RE Engine that allows for new audio and visual peaks
          that up the tension in satisfying ways.
        </p>

        <p>
          Resident Evil 4 is out on March 24 for PlayStation 4/5, Xbox Series
          X|S and PC, and we completed a playthrough on the PS5 version. For
          those interested in diving back into Mr. Kennedy’s standout
          adventure, here are our thoughts after a 15-hour playthrough.
        </p>

        <p>
          As with the original game, Ashley sticks closely to Leon for a large
          majority of Resident Evil 4. The good thing is that this time
          around, she doesn’t have a separate health meter. If she’s attacked
          and immobilized, Leon can get Ashley back on her feet before a
          game-ending fatal blow. Outside of that, there are still two
          commands to have her wait or follow depending on the situation.
          There are even a handful of moments where she can hide in places
          like lockers and assist Leon with obstacles including climbing over
          openings to unlock a gate from the other side. If foes capture
          Ashley and carry her to the nearest exit, it’s still game over as
          well.
        </p>

        <p>
          It would have been nice to have Ashley be more dynamic as an AI
          partner this time around. Outside of the sequence mentioned
          previously, the president’s daughter comes off as a nuisance
          sometimes and gets in the way enough to be frustrating when the
          action heats up. It doesn’t help that one accidental shot to her is
          also game-ending. In a time where The Last of Us set standards for
          AI partners, it would have been nice for Ashley to be more than
          someone players have to babysit.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are some serious changes to the moment where players control
          Ashley directly. It’s pretty much a complete rework. Unlike the
          original, she doesn’t have any offensive capabilities like
          lantern-throwing as her section is solely based around hiding,
          running and simple puzzle-solving. Ashley’s portion isn’t that long
          or frustrating and has some frightening moments, but it’s nowhere as
          good as the original.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the strangest additions to Resident Evil 4’s modernized
          reintroduction is the inclusion of a crouch button for getting under
          obstacles and stealth purposes. Outside of a short earlier moment
          where Leon loses all of his equipment and has to silently kill a
          handful of foes, it’s fairly useless for several reasons. The most
          obvious is that the enemy AI isn’t that dynamic enough outside of
          flanking tactics.
        </p>

        <p>
          There really aren’t many options if players want to play more
          stealthily, distract enemies or set up traps. Once foes spot Leon,
          they’ll know where he is at all times, so there’s no way to play a
          cat-and-mouse game like players can in games like The Last of Us —
          which took a lot of inspiration from the original Resident Evil 4.
          Despite a light crafting system, players can’t craft traps and the
          only ways to kill enemies silently are solely through the knife or
          bolt gun.
        </p>

        <p>
          Considering how much care went into updating the core combat of
          Resident Evil 4, it’s a shame the stealth options are so limited.
          Thankfully, it doesn’t break the game or take away from the exciting
          action.

          You can expect a total playthrough to be somewhere in the ballpark
          of 15 to 20 hours. That playtime can scale up around an extra five
          or so for completionists. There’s a New Game+ mode to replay the
          game with all the equipment from the initial playthrough alongside
          harder difficulty settings. Throughout the game, players will
          receive CP points for completing various challenges that can be
          spent on everything from new costumes and various models to in-game
          weaponry. Outside of that, there isn’t very much available after
          finishing the single player at launch.
